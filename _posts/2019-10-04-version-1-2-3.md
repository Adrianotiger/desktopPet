There was an annoying bug, cutting the pet when it was leaving the screen just for a few pixels.

In the last release, I begun to cut the pet when it was leaving the screen.
In this way, if you have 2 or more screens the pet didn't walked on the second screen to disappear.

Unfortunately, if the pet returned to the screen without respawn, it was cut.
Hope it will work now :)

The UWP will be published in the next hours if everything is ok for Microsoft.

From now, the installed pet (portable) will always check GitHub for a new version of the app and downalod it from there. 
I can definitively remove my esheep.petrucci.ch page now!

Thank you for your help and all your feedbacks!
