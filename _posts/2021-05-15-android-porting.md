<h2>Test version for Android</h2>

With Xamarin, it is possible to write c# apps for Android.

So, with just some small changes, I was able to port the sheep also on the play store.

You can download a test version from here (it is not public - you need this direct link to download it):  
<h3>Download from <a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.petrucci.androsheep'>Google Play</a></h3>

It is just a test, not an alpha or beta version. So please do not report any issue or requests! 
If you like it, you can post your comments on this blog post.

Developer problems:
If a Xamarin or Android developer can help me with the screen/bar sizes I would be really happy! 
1. I need to use the screen density and dp to convert my pets to the right size as it should still be pixelated. But I can't understand what I need to convert (screen, menu bar, navigation bar, ...)
2. I need to detect the size of the key bar (bottom) and the status bar (top). I need also to find out the available screen size. Still can't find a good solution to retrieve all sizes.
