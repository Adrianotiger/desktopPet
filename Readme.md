If you had a lot of them on the desktop... welcome to this page!<br />
This project gives you the possibility to add a pet to your desktop.<br />
<br />
With a XML file (animations.xml) it is possible to change pet and animations.<br />
<h1>Application</h1>
This application is not a game, not an utility and not useful :P it simply shows you
a pet on the screen. This pet can fall down up to the taskbar and is able to detect 
windows on your desktop.<br />
In this way, this pet is able to walk, run, etc around your working screen area (on primary screen).
<h1>Download</h1>
You can download a compiled Windows EXE from this page:

There is also a documentation for the entire code:
<a href='https://github.com/Adrianotiger/desktopPet/tree/master/Docs'>API Docs</a>
<h1>Want to create your own mate/pet?</h1>
The easy and fast way is to use the online editor:
<a href='http://esheep.petrucci.ch/?pagina=editor'>Online editor</a>.
But you can also download the original <a href='Resources/animations.xml'>animations.xml</a> and create your own desktop mate/pet.<br />
What you need are:
<ul>
<li>1 application icon (.ico file)
<li>1 animation image: an image with transparency with all possible positions. (.png not too big... Something like 1000x500 px)
</ul><br />
