<h1>What is eSheep?</h1>
This sheep is a <b>screen mate</b>. It isn't really an application, it will not help you for anything and is not an utility.
So in facts, it is an inutility.<br>
<br>
<em>Note: this is not the original sheep! As the original does not work on 64-bit systems. It is just a copy of the original one!</em><br>
<br>
This screen mate is just able to "detect" your windows, task and screen borders. In this way it is able to walk around staying in topmost.<br>
<br>
The original sheep was made in 1995 and was distributed with many names:<br>
<ul>
<li> eSheep
<li> Scmpoo
<li> Screen mate Poo
<li> Stray Sheep
</ul>
<br>
<h1>Stray Sheep</h1>

<h2>Who is this sheep?</h2>
The Sheep program is based on the work of Japanese animator Tatsutoshi Nomura's 1994 "Stray Sheep" series of five-minute animation shorts that were shown at midnight on the Fuji Television network in Japan. <br>
<br>
A series of books followed from Mr. Nomura a decade later as well as other merchandise including Playstation games.<br>
