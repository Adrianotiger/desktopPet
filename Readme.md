---

With a XML file (animations.xml) it is possible to change pet and animations.<br />
# Application
This application is not a game, not an utility and not useful :P it simply shows you
a pet on the screen. This pet can fall down up to the taskbar and is able to detect 
windows on your desktop.<br />
In this way, this pet is able to walk, run, etc around your working screen area (on primary screen).
# Download

# Want to create your own mate/pet?
The easy and fast way is to use the online editor:
<a href='http://esheep.petrucci.ch/?pagina=editor'>Online editor</a>.<br>
But you can also download the original <a href='Resources/animations.xml'>animations.xml</a> and create your own desktop mate/pet.<br />
What you need are:
<ul>
<li>1 application icon (.ico file)
<li>1 animation image: an image with transparency with all possible positions. (.png not too big... Something like 1000x500 px)
</ul><br />
