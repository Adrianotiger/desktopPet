<h2>Solved bugs:</h2>

- Childs  
  - On multiscreens, a child (second animation) never appeared on the secondary screen.
- Sounds  
  - Due a wrong sound library version, the sounds never played in the last release.
- Settings
  - Settings didn't loaded correctly in the portable version
  - If you saved something, on the next start, the default value was token

<h2>New features</h2>

- Now you can move the window and the mate will move with it, without falling down
- Negima! mascots added to the pets*
- The taskbar was always hiding the pet. Now the pet will try to set the topmost on each animation. Probably I have to remove this if you can't use the taskbar anymore...

<h2>For UWP / Windows store app</h2>

- the settings didn't applied immediately, but only after a new start - [issue 37](https://github.com/Adrianotiger/desktopPet/issues/37)  
- volume settings had a strange format (example 10.500000005% instead of 10.5%)

Negima! has a collection of many characters (mascots). I added 2 just to show how they are, for more info, visit the mate page: https://adrianotiger.github.io/desktopPet/Pets/negima/

Thank you for your help and all your feedbacks!
