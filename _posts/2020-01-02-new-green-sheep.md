<h2>Version 7.0 is available</h2>

Oliver released a new version of the green sheep (the best replication of the sheep on this app) with a lot of improvements.  
Since the app will not update the pet automatically (maybe in future), you have to download the new version under options, in your tray icon.

For more information about it and write some comments directly to the designer, open this page:

Thank you Oliver and all followers :D

Happy New Year!
