Do you want create your own screen mate? It is simple once you have a sprite sheet. If you have it, 90% of the work is already done!<br>
Now you just need to set a sequence to let it animate. This is done with a xml file.<br>

<h1>Pet editor</h1>
If you want begin with the simple way, just download the free editor for editing this xml from this repository:<br>
<a href="https://github.com/Adrianotiger/desktopPet/releases" target="_blank">https://github.com/Adrianotiger/desktopPet/releases</a><br>
<br>
But if you are a guru, you can also download a simple XML editor and write it by yourself.<br>
The XML is documented in the <a href="https://github.com/Adrianotiger/desktopPet/wiki/XML%5CIntroduction">WIKI</a> section of this page.<br>
<br>
<h1>Sprite sheets</h1>
It is not easy to create a good pixel sprite sheet. So, the easiest way is to download a sheet from the web.<br>
You can find some resources from <a href="https://adrianotiger.github.io/desktopPet/2019/07/02/sprite-sheets.html">this blog post</a>.<br>
If you are a good designer, you can create your own sprites and use <a href="https://adrianotiger.github.io/desktopPet/2019/07/02/sprite-sheets.html">some tools</a> to create a sprite sheet.<br>
<br>
<h1>Icon</h1>
The xml animation has an icon, this must be 48x48 pixel. If you have just an image, you can use some converters like:<br>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://icoconvert.com/" target="_blank">https://icoconvert.com/</a>
</ul>
<br>
<h1>Base64</h1>
Icon and spritesheet are merged in the xml file. So they have to be base64-formatted. If you use the pet editor, this is done automatically. But you can convert online your files with:<br>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.browserling.com/tools/file-to-base64" target="_blank">https://www.browserling.com/tools/file-to-base64</a>
<li><a href="https://www.base64-image.de/" target="_blank">https://www.base64-image.de/</a>
</ul>
