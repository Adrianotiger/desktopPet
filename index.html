Can you remember this application from the '95? This nice sheep covered our desktops for years :D <br>
Since, this application was a 16-bit version and it doesn't work anymore on Windows7/8/10, I wrote a little application in c# to see this sheep again on the desktop! 
<br>
<div class="page">
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    <article class="post-box">

      <h1><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        {{ post.excerpt }}
      </div>

      <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ post.url }}" class="read-more">Read More</a>
      <br>
      <hr width="80%">
      <br>
    </article>
  {% endfor %}
</div>
