This will be the next official page for the esheep project.

I want to move everything to GitHub and once the webpage is here, I can linke everything to this webserver.

There is also a Disqus-chat for every blog entry and also for every screen mate! So if you upload your pet, everyone can give you a feedback!

Hope you enjoy it, even if it is not so colorfull like the old webpage.
