# What is eSheep?
This sheep is a <b>screen mate</b>. It isn't really an application, it will not help you for anything and is not an utility.
So in facts, it is an inutility.

<b>Note: this is not the original sheep! As the original does not work on 64-bit systems. It is just a copy of the original one!</b>

This screen mate is just able to "detect" your windows, task and screen borders. In this way it is able to walk around staying in topmost.

The original sheep was made in 1995 and was distributed with many names:
- eSheep
- Scmpoo
- Screen mate Poo
- Stray Sheep

## Who is this sheep?
The Sheep program is based on the work of Japanese animator Tatsutoshi Nomura's 1994 "Stray Sheep" series of five-minute animation shorts that were shown at midnight on the Fuji Television network in Japan. 

A series of books followed from Mr. Nomura a decade later as well as other merchandise including Playstation games.
